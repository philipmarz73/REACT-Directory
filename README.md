# REACT Directory

This Project was aimed at creating an Employee Directory with React. A User can view his/her entire Directory, with several input fields for employee data at once. These fields include First and Last Name, Phone Number, Email, DOB, and ID number. A thumbnail photo of each employee is also included. In order for this directory to be fully functional, it is required that the User can sort the table of Employees by at least one category (in this case, alphabetically by First Name) and filter the users by at least one property (Phone number). The User also has the choice of sorting in ascending or descending order.
